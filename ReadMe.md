# TaskManagerMvc 🗂️

This is a simple ASP.NET Core MVC application implementing a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing tasks.

## 📚 Technologies Used:
- C# (ASP.NET Core MVC)
- Razor Views (.cshtml)
- InMemory data storage (List<Task>)
- HTML & CSS

## 📝 Project Description:
The application demonstrates a basic CRUD interface for a Task model, including:
- Creating new tasks
- Viewing all tasks
- Editing existing tasks
- Deleting tasks

Data is stored **in memory** within the application, so all tasks will be lost when the app stops running. This is intended for learning and testing purposes.

## ⚠️ Important Usage Note:
To access the Task Manager pages, you need to append `/Task` to the base URL.
